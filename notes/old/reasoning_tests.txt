Q. theme: theme: computer science concept. seed: 92834234.
hint: Welcome to today's lecture on [TERM] in computer science. [TERM] is a fundamental concept that helps manage complexity in software development. It allows programmers to focus on high-level functionality without worrying about low-level details. Think of [TERM] as a way to create a simplified model of a complex system. We use [TERM] in everyday life. For example, driving a car without needing to understand how the engine works. In programming, [TERM] can be applied in various forms, such as functions, classes, and interfaces. Let's start with functions. A function [TERMS] a specific task, allowing us to use it without knowing its inner workings. For instance, consider a function that sorts a list. We use the function without needing to know the sorting algorithm. Next, we have classes, which provide a blueprint for creating objects. Classes [TERM] the properties and behaviors of real-world entities. For example, a class Car can [TERM] the characteristics of a car, such as its make, model, and functions like drive() and brake(). Interfaces, on the other hand, define a contract for what a class should do, without specifying how it should do it. An interface might specify that a class must have a save() method, but the implementation details are left to the class itself. [TERM] not only helps in code readability but also in maintainability and scalability of software. By hiding unnecessary details, [TERM] allows developers to work more efficiently and collaboratively. Let's dive deeper into each type of [TERM], starting with functional [TERM]. We'll look at how functions can simplify complex operations and make code more reusable. Next, we'll explore object-oriented [TERM] and how classes and objects can model real-world scenarios. Finally, we'll discuss abstract data types and interfaces, and their role in defining clear and consistent APIs.
A. abstraction
