BufferWindowMemory (k = 5 most recent input messages): Gets 1 and 2, misses 3.
EntityMemory (k = 3 most recent input messages): Gets 1 and 2 purely due to buffer window memory, misses 3. It looks for nearly exact (probably exact) matches in the entity dictionary, which is sort of useless.
ConversationSummaryMemory: Gets 1, partially misses 2 due to failing to summarize key information. Gets 3 purely because the summary length is unrestricted. Fails 4 due to not using transitivity. Skipped 5.
ConversationSummaryBufferMemory (t = 128 token limit, applies only to the buffer): Gets 1, mostly gets 2, gets 3, mostly gets 4. Mostly misses 5, because the summary is so full of useless info that it obscures the important stuff.
VectorStoreRetrieverMemory (r = 3 most relevant input/response pairs): Gets 1, mostly gets 2, gets 3, partial on 4 due to not making a firm connection, gets 5.
