This list will evolve as the bot progresses.

## Current Tasks

### Today

- [ ] Plan out how Bob will be structured (at a high level) in V2

### Todo

hi

### Future

hi

## Completed Tasks

### Basics

- [x] Finally finish setting up the Python development environment

## Milestones and Capstones

### Text

- [x] Have Bob send a hello world message in Discord (7/13/24)
- [x] Hold a decently intelligble conversation with someone (7/13/24)
- [x] Demonstrate flexibility by playing 20 questions (7/14/24)
- [x] Demonstrate emerging reasoning skills by identifying League champs (7/15/24)
- [x] Recognize and be able to vaguely discuss images (8/18/24)
- [ ] Demonstrate improved reasoning skills by playing Jeopardy decently
- [ ] Send multiple messages at once, or send no messages when appropriate in a non-hacky way
- [ ] Initiate a DM or group chat conversation after being inactive for a while
- [ ] Remember details about people from a long time ago, say >50 messages
- [ ] Have a persistent mood and/or life story through simulated emotions and events
- [ ] Understand the difference between DMs and servers, and participate in both of them
- [ ] **Capstone:** Hold an emotional and long (requiring memory) chat conversation in DMs while acting similar to a human
- [ ] **Capstone:** Act like a normal, active Discord user in a medium sized server, replying to or initiating messages

### Voice

- [x] Join voice chat and play some music (7/15/24)
- [x] Be able to respond intelligbly to someone talking in voice chat (7/18/24)
- [ ] Respond in a more human-like voice
- [ ] Generate a response in near real-time, quick enough to not be awkward
- [ ] Integrate text chat capabilities (memory, emotions, reasoning) into voice chat
- [ ] **Capstone:** Participate decently in a group voice chat, in real-time!

### Gaming

- [ ] Play Chess at a rating > 800, for an easy-to-play (ish) proof of concept
- [ ] Play Skribbl.io, a medium difficulty game involving images
- [ ] **Capstone:** Play League, a comprehensive, tough game with an anticheat

### All Together

- [ ] **Capstone:** Have a user ask Bob to join voice chat, then ask to play a game on Discord, then have him actually join and play that video game!

From [the initial Node.js version](https://github.com/Giantpizzahead/bob-bot-ts):

## (Old) TypeScript Era

- [x] Initial bot setup, texting, commands, etc (didn't have a todo list in the beginning)
- [x] Encourage the bot to send many more messages than 1 or 2
- [x] Emulate work and sleep times, for realism and also to avoid distractions
- [x] Try to implement reasoning skills but realize that it's kinda not very good
- [x] Implement a period update to allow Bob to initiate its own messages
- [x] Make the bot send messages unprompted after long, random delays
- [x] Implement simple TTS
- [x] Switch to openrouter api
- [x] Create a small eval suite for models
- [x] Test top roleplay rated cheap models
- [x] Switch to an uncensored model using OpenRouter
- [x] Change Bob's status when working or sleeping
- [x] Make a bare bones version of Bob (text only) for ease of testing and development
- [x] Try out Langchain with JS, see how it works
- [x] Begin looking into short and long term memory
- [x] Implement a RAG system using LangChain, embeddings, lookup queries, and a vector store
- [x] Try out LangChain tool (function) calling
- [x] Integrate an online search engine into bare bones Bob
- [x] Try other forms of conversational memory (apart from just a buffer)
- [x] Try persistent, multi-agent paradigms in LangGraph
- [x] Try persistent, multi-agent paradigms using other tools
- [x] Allow bob to see image attachments without throwing errors for invalid images or other attachments
- [x] Feed images into an image-to-text tool, or try a multi-modal model
- [x] Consider whether or not to migrate to Python (Answer: No, this is good.)
- [x] Setup TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier following https://typescript-eslint.io/getting-started/
- [x] Setup testing and CI / CD with Github and Vitest following https://vitest.dev/
- [x] Cleanup/move repository from Heroku to Github, then deploy to Heroku
- [x] Archive the JS/TS repository for good code style practice, and start again in a new Python repo
